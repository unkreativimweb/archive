# Tic Tac Toe Game Website

## Overview
This project is a simple, interactive website featuring a Tic Tac Toe game, developed during an internship at Staffbase. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It was my very first dive into web development.
_(this readme was written a long time after the game was finished)_
